##DISCLAIMER
- This is just a little project because I was bored. NONE of the given values about estimated performance are 100% accurate! This tool is meant to guide and help you configure your own PC. I am not responsible for any false purchases and potential disappointment in performance.
- Prices are average values and subject to change. Therefore, use them as a form of guideline instead of a concrete and 100% correct value.
